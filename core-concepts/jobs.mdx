## Overview

Jobs correspond to individual jobs, vacancies, or job postings. You can publish these on your company website's career portal, for example, or as a campaign on various publication channels such as job boards, social media platforms, or other channels. In combination with application forms, you can collect applications for positions and move them through the application processes designated for those positions.

You can find an overview of all Jobs in the main navigation bar on the left under “Jobs".

## Create job advertisements

You can create Jobs either from within a [Project ](/core-concepts/projects)(recommended) or directly via the Jobs item. It is always possible to assign [Accounts](/core-concepts/accounts), [Contacts](/core-concepts/contacts), [Projects](/core-concepts/projects), or applications to the Job at a later date.
