## Overview

Notes are flexible, rich-content records in your Activity Timeline that help you capture important information, observations, and insights about your accounts, contacts, candidates, projects, and applications. Unlike other activity types that track specific interactions (calls, meetings, emails), notes serve as your digital notepad for documenting anything that matters to your work.

## What are Notes?

Notes are one of five activity types in Nexus Search:

- **Tasks** - Action items and to-dos
- **Calls** - Phone call records
- **Meetings** - Meeting documentation
- **Emails** - Email communications
- **Notes** - Flexible documentation (you are here)

Notes stand out because they're the most versatile activity type—use them for meeting summaries, research findings, quick observations, reminders, or any information you want to preserve and associate with your records.

## Creating a Note

### Quick Start

1. Navigate to any entity (account, contact, candidate, project, or application)
2. Find the Activity Timeline section
3. Click the **Note** button in the activity toolbar
4. Fill in your note details
5. Click **Create Note**

### Note Form Fields

#### Note Title (Optional)

A brief, descriptive title for your note. While optional, titles make notes easier to scan in the timeline.

**Examples:**
- "Discovery Call Summary"
- "Technical Interview Feedback"
- "Company Research Notes"
- "Follow-up Reminder"

**When to use titles:**

✅ For notes you'll reference later
✅ When creating formal documentation
✅ For notes that represent specific events or insights
❌ For quick, informal observations (title optional)

#### Note Type

Categorize your note to help organize and filter your timeline. Choose from five types:

| Type | Icon | Best For |
|------|------|----------|
| **General Note** | 📝 | Default choice for miscellaneous notes and observations |
| **Meeting Note** | 🗓️ | Post-meeting summaries, action items, and decisions |
| **Call Note** | 📞 | Notes from phone conversations |
| **Research** | 🔍 | Background research, company information, competitive intelligence |
| **Reminder** | ⏰ | Important reminders and follow-up notes |

**Note:** The note type is for organization only. All types have the same features and capabilities.

#### Content Format

Choose how you want your note content to be stored and displayed:

| Format | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Plain Text** | Simple, unformatted text | Quick notes, simple documentation |
| **Markdown** | Markdown-formatted content | Technical documentation, structured notes |
| **HTML** | Rich HTML formatting | Formatted documents with styles and structure |

**Recommended:** Start with Plain Text for most notes. The rich text editor (explained below) will use HTML format when you apply formatting.

#### Note Content

The main body of your note. This field supports rich text formatting through an advanced editor with the following capabilities:

**Text Formatting:**
- **Bold**, *Italic*, <u>Underline</u>, ~~Strikethrough~~
- Headings (H2, H3)
- Text colors

**Structure:**
- Bullet lists

- Reference links

**Formatting Toolbar:**

## Linking Notes to Entities

One of the most powerful features of notes is the ability to link them to multiple entities simultaneously.

### Related Records

When creating a note, you can associate it with:

- **Accounts** - Company/organization records
- **Contacts** - Individual people
- **Candidates** - Job candidates
- **Projects** - Projects or hiring initiatives
- **Jobs** - Job postings
- **Applications** - Job applications

### Multi-Entity Notes

A single note can relate to multiple entities across different types. This is incredibly useful for:

**Cross-Reference Documentation:**
- Document a meeting with 2 contacts from 1 account about 1 project
- Link all entities in a single note
- Note appears in all related entity timelines

**Example Use Cases:**
- Client meeting notes linked to account, multiple contacts, and related project
- Interview notes linked to candidate, application, and job
- Research notes about a company linked to account and multiple contacts
- Conference call notes with multiple participants

**How Linking Works:**
1. When creating a note, select **Related Records**
2. Choose entity types (Account, Contact, Candidate, etc.)
3. Search and select specific records
4. The note appears in the Activity Timeline of all linked entities
5. Entity badges show on the note in the timeline

## Data Management Agent Integration

Nexus Search includes an AI-powered **Data Management Agent (DMAA)** that analyzes your notes to keep your data up-to-date automatically.

### How It Works

1. You create a note with information about an entity
2. DMAA analyzes the content to identify key facts and changes
3. DMAA proposes updates to entity fields based on the note
4. You review and approve suggested changes
5. Your data stays current without manual updates

### Example Scenario

**Your Note:**
> "Just spoke with Michael Johnson. He mentioned he recently joined Acme Corp as VP of Sales. Their team is expanding rapidly and they're looking to hire 5 engineers this quarter."

**DMAA Detects:**
- Contact job title changed: "HR Director" → "VP of Sales"
- Contact company changed: "Previous Corp" → "Acme Corp"
- Account hiring plans: 5 engineering positions planned

**DMAA Proposes:**
- Update Michael's job title to "VP of Sales"
- Update Michael's company to "Acme Corp"
- Add note to Acme Corp account about hiring plans

You approve or reject each proposal with confidence scores and reasoning provided.

### Benefits

- **Saves Time** - No manual data entry after calls or meetings
- **Reduces Errors** - Consistent data updates with evidence trail
- **Captures Context** - Links updates back to source notes
- **Improves Data Quality** - Keeps your CRM/ATS current automatically

## Best Practices

### When to Create a Note

**✅ Do Create Notes For:**

- Important insights from calls or meetings
- Research findings about companies or candidates
- Post-interaction summaries
- Quick observations that don't fit other activity types
- Follow-up reminders
- Context that future-you will appreciate
- Information that should be shared with your team

**❌ Don't Create Notes For:**

- Formal meetings (use Meeting activity instead)
- Phone calls (use Call activity instead)
- Tasks or to-dos (use Task activity instead)
- Email content (emails are automatically captured)

### Writing Effective Notes

**Be Specific:**

❌ "Had a good conversation"
✅ "Michael expressed strong interest in our Q2 hiring timeline. Wants to schedule follow-up for next Tuesday."

**Include Context:**

❌ "Needs follow-up"
✅ "Follow-up needed by Friday 3/15 to discuss contract terms mentioned in today's call. Michael prefers morning meetings."

**Use Formatting:**

- Use bullet points for lists
- Bold key facts or decisions
- Use headings to organize long notes
- Add links to relevant resources

**Link Relevant Entities:**

- Always link notes to all relevant accounts, contacts, candidates, etc.
- This ensures team members see the note in the right context
- Creates a complete activity history across entities

### Note Types Strategy

**General Note:**
- Default choice for most situations
- Quick observations
- Miscellaneous documentation

**Meeting Note:**
- Post-meeting summaries
- Capture decisions, action items, and key discussion points
- Even better: Use the Meeting activity type for formal meetings

**Call Note:**
- Quick notes after phone conversations
- When you don't need the full Call activity structure
- Brief conversation summaries

**Research:**
- Company background information
- Competitive intelligence
- Market research
- Candidate background research

**Reminder:**
- Important follow-ups
- Deadline reminders
- Things you need to remember
- **Note:** Consider using Tasks for actionable reminders

### Privacy Guidelines

**Make Private:**
- Personal opinions or assessments
- Confidential information
- Sensitive feedback
- Draft thoughts

**Keep Shared (Default):**
- Factual information
- Meeting summaries
- Research findings
- Team-relevant insights

### Pinning Strategy

Pin sparingly to maintain effectiveness:

- Only pin truly important notes
- Unpin notes once action is taken or information is outdated
- Use as temporary "highlight" rather than permanent flag
- Consider: Do I need to see this note every time I view this entity?
