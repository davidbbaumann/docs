The Activity Timeline is a central feature in Nexus Search that provides a chronological record of all interactions, tasks, and communications related to your records. It serves as a complete history of engagement with your Accounts, Contacts, Candidates, Projects, Jobs, and Applications.

## Overview

The Activity Timeline consolidates five types of activities into a single, organized view:

| Activity Type | Icon     | Description                                    |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Task**      | Checkbox | Action items, to-dos, and follow-up work       |
| **Call**      | Phone    | Phone call records with outcomes and notes     |
| **Meeting**   | People   | Scheduled meetings with agendas and recordings |
| **Email**     | Envelope | Email communications sent and received         |
| **Note**      | Document | Internal notes and observations                |

Each activity type has its own dedicated documentation with detailed field descriptions and workflows:

- [Tasks](/activities/tasks)
- [Calls](/activities/calls)
- [Meetings](/activities/meetings)
- [Emails](/activities/emails)
- [Notes](/activities/notes)

## Where to Find Activity Timelines

Activity Timelines are available on the profile pages of all major record types:

- **Account Profile** → Activity tab
- **Contact Profile** → Activity tab
- **Candidate Profile** → Activity tab
- **Project Profile** → Activity tab
- **Job Profile** → Activity tab
- **Application Profile** → Activity tab

## Key Features

### Creating Activities

You can create new activities directly from the Activity Timeline using the quick-action buttons in the header:

1. **Task** - Create a new task with title, description, due date, and priority
2. **Call** - Log an inbound or outbound call with duration and outcome
3. **Meeting** - Schedule a meeting with participants, location, and agenda
4. **Email** - Compose and send an email (opens the email composer)
5. **Note** - Add internal notes or observations

When you create an activity from a record's timeline, that activity is automatically linked to the record.

### Viewing Activity Details

Each activity in the timeline displays:

- **Title or Subject** - The primary identifier of the activity
- **Type and Subtype** - Visual indicator of the activity type (e.g., "video_call" for meetings)
- **Creator** - Who created or logged the activity
- **Timestamp** - When the activity was created (displayed as relative time, e.g., "about 1 month ago")
- **Related Records** - Badges showing linked Accounts, Contacts, Candidates, Projects, Jobs, and Users

Click **"Show details"** to expand an activity and view additional information such as:

- Full descriptions and notes
- Status and priority (for tasks)
- Duration and outcome (for calls)
- Participant list and meeting notes (for meetings)
- Email body and attachments (for emails)

### Expand All / Collapse All

Use the **Expand All** button to view detailed information for all activities at once. Click again to collapse all expanded entries.

### Search and Filter

Click **Search & Filter** to access powerful filtering options:

#### Text Search

Search across activity titles, descriptions, and content to quickly find specific activities.

#### Filter by Activity Type

Filter the timeline to show only specific activity types:

- All Types (default)
- Tasks
- Calls
- Meetings
- Emails
- Notes

#### Date Range Filter

Narrow down activities to a specific time period:

- **From Date** - Show activities from this date onward
- **To Date** - Show activities up to this date

Active filters are displayed as badges below the filter controls. Click **Clear** to reset all filters.

### Pagination

For records with many activities, the timeline is paginated for optimal performance:

- View the current range (e.g., "Showing 1 to 25 of 60 activities")
- Change the number of items displayed per page (10, 25, 50, or 100)
- Navigate between pages using the pagination controls

### Editing Activities

Click the **Edit** icon (pencil) on any activity to modify its details. This opens an edit modal where you can update:

- Activity type-specific fields
- Related records
- Status and priority
- Dates and times

### Deleting Activities

Click the **More options** menu (three dots) on an activity to access the delete option. You will be asked to confirm before the activity is permanently removed.

## Related Records

Activities can be linked to multiple records simultaneously. For example, a meeting activity might be linked to:

- An Account (the company)
- Multiple Contacts (meeting attendees)
- A Project (the subject of the meeting)
- Assigned Users (your team members)

Related records appear as color-coded badges on each activity:

- **Blue (Building icon)** - Accounts
- **Green (Person icon)** - Contacts
- **Purple (Briefcase icon)** - Projects
- **Orange (Document icon)** - Jobs
- **Pink (Person checkmark icon)** - Candidates
- **Gray (People icon)** - Users

## Real-Time Updates

The Activity Timeline updates in real-time. When a colleague creates, edits, or deletes an activity on a shared record, you'll see the changes reflected immediately without needing to refresh the page.

## Empty State

When a record has no activities yet, you'll see a message: **"No activities found"** with guidance to start tracking activities. If you have active filters that return no results, a message will suggest adjusting your search criteria.

## Best Practices

1. **Log activities promptly** - Record calls, meetings, and notes soon after they occur for accurate tracking
2. **Use descriptive titles** - Make activity titles clear and searchable
3. **Link related records** - Connect activities to all relevant Accounts, Contacts, Candidates, and Projects
4. **Add follow-up tasks** - Create tasks for action items that emerge from calls and meetings
5. **Use filters effectively** - Filter by type and date to quickly review specific interaction history
