<Update label="CW 09 | February 2026">
  ## New features

  ### Company logos from favicons (Account, Workspace, Application Forms)

  - To take advantage of the recognition value of company logos, the favicons of the company websites (always the first domain) are loaded and can now be seen in the list of companies and on their detail page.
  - The favicon of the domain specified in your workspace is used as the workspace logo.
  - Application forms use the favicon stored in your workspace and no longer the Nexus favicon to increase the branding effect.

  ### Content Studio

  Content Studio allows you to create ready-made and reusable templates. These can be used, for example, to quickly create emails, notes, tasks, or calls.

  All templates access variables and can thus be dynamically filled with content at the time of creation. The following templates are available:

  - Notes
  - Tasks
  - Meetings
  - Emails

  ## Improvements

  ### Activity Timeline

  - The buttons in the activity timeline now adjust to the screen width.
  - Sent and received email activities can no longer be edited/changed. Only the addition/removal of related records is permitted.
