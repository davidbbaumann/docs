  ## New Features

  ### Content Management Agent (CMA) for images & creatives
  
  The Content Management Agent (CMA) analyzes images uploaded to Content Studio. When new images/creatives are uploaded, users can activate the Content Management Agent (activated by default). The CMA performs three main tasks:
  - **Description**: The uploaded image is provided with an (internal) description in natural language.
  - **Alt text**: Alternative texts relevant for public images are created. These are short, descriptive image descriptions that are also relevant for SEO.
  - **ARIA description**: Short descriptions are created explicitly in accordance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2, which are designed to increase accessibility on the web.
  
  ### Prompt Templates
  
  The new Prompt Template template type allows you to define recurring prompts for the AI, e.g., recurring analyses according to specific specifications, merging of information, or other tasks for the AI that are to be repeated in the same way, e.g., for different Accounts, Contacts, Projects, Candidates, or applications.

  ## Improvements

  ### Content Studio
  
  Templates can now be deleted and cloned/duplicated directly in the table overview.

  ## Bug Fixes
  
  - Duplicate success messages when cloning/deleting forms have been standardized.
  - Upload errors due to image uploads that are too large in Content Studio have been fixed. Only uploads up to a maximum of 15 MB per image are possible.
  - Various translation errors in the job section have been fixed.
  - Problems with white areas when scrolling on long pages have been resolved.

  ## New features

  ### Company logos from favicons (Account, Workspace, Application Forms)

  - To take advantage of the recognition value of company logos, the favicons of the company websites (always the first domain) are loaded and can now be seen in the list of companies and on their detail page.
  - The favicon of the domain specified in your workspace is used as the workspace logo.
  - Application forms use the favicon stored in your workspace and no longer the Nexus favicon to increase the branding effect.

  ### Content Studio

  Content Studio allows you to create ready-made and reusable templates. These can be used, for example, to quickly create emails, notes, tasks, or calls.

  All templates access variables and can thus be dynamically filled with content at the time of creation. The following templates are available:

  - Notes
  - Tasks
  - Meetings
  - Emails

  ## Improvements

  ### Activity Timeline

  - The buttons in the activity timeline now adjust to the screen width.
  - Sent and received email activities can no longer be edited/changed. Only the addition/removal of related records is permitted.
